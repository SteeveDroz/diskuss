## About Diskuss

### The project

Diskuss was originally created for a school project. It has been made by a teacher whose students had to learn about RESTful APIs. The goal of the exercise was to create a client for Diskuss, each student using a different language and implementing what they thought was interresting to add client-side.

As many other chat servers and clients exist on the market, there are no practical uses for such a half-made network, except the one described hereinabove. If you are a teacher of any kind and you want to use any of my work with your students, please *do* and give me a feedback if you have the time.

###Release notes

Release notes can be found in the **[change log](changelog.md])**.
