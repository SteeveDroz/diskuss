[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SteeveDroz/diskuss.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SteeveDroz/diskuss)

Diskuss is a Node.js chat server that offers an API but no official client.

## Install

2. Download the [latest version](https://github.com/SteeveDroz/diskuss/releases/latest) of diskuss and unzip it.
3. From the directory where `server.js` is located, use the command line `npm install` to download and install dependencies.
4. Run the server with `npm start`.
5. Open a browser (or IE if you don't have any) and connect to your server on port 8081. If you access that address from the same computer as the one you started the server on, simply follow **[this link](http://127.0.0.1:8081)**. The description of the API is located at the root of the application.

## About Diskuss

### The project

Diskuss was originally created for a school project. It has been made by a teacher whose students had to learn about RESTful APIs. The goal of the exercise was to create a client for Diskuss, each student using a different language and implementing what they thought was interresting to add client-side.

As many other chat servers and clients exist on the market, there are no practical uses for such a half-made network, except the one described hereinabove. If you are a teacher of any kind and you want to use any of my work with your students, please *do* and give me a feedback if you have the time.

### Release notes

Release notes can be found in the **[change log](changelog.md)**.
