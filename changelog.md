# Changelog

Here are all the updates since v1.0

## [v1.4]: Moderated update

Channels now belong to the user who first joined it.

Changes:

- An owner (and only them) can:
 - Change the description of the channel
 - Keep or release the channel
 - Permanently transfer their ownership of the channel to another user
- Update of all the notices example to include owners
- Various bug fixes

## [v1.3]: Channel update

**:warning: This update breaks a little backwards compatibility! The notices have changed**

The "channel" side of the application has been developped.

- Channel descriptions can be changed.
- Channels can be kept even if no user is in (the description will remain, more features are to be added)
- Notices have been changed. When a channel name was part of it, it has been replaced by a channel object containing all the useful data.
- Use of JavaScript in the API to ease the writing of new features.
- Various bug fixes.

## [v1.2]: Logical update

**:warning: This update breaks backwards compatibility!**

To be more logical, the responses have been changed. It was, for example, not logical at all that leaving a channel would return the user object of oneself.

The following responses have been updated:

- **Disconnection** now sends a JSON object with `status` property.
- **Join channel** now sends a JSON object containing a `channel` and a `users` propoerties.
- **Talk in channel** now sends a JSON object containing a `status` and a `message` properties.
- **Leave channel** now sends a JSON object containing a `status` and a `channel` properties.
- **Send private message** now sends a JSON object containing a `status`, a `message` and a `recipient` properties.

## [v1.1.2]: Idle update

The following features have been fixed:

- The last user leaving a channel destroys it.
- Asking for a list of channels returns the expected value.

## [v1.1.1]: Idle update

The informations about v1.1 have been added to the API.

## [v1.1]: Idle update

Diskuss uses notices to check if users are still connected. The server postulates that any client that hasn't checked for notices in the last 5 seconds must be disconnected and removes it from the list of users.
